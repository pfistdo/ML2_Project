# ML2_Project
This is the final project in the course Machine Learning II @ ZHAW School of management and law.

# Goal and motivation
The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict a dogs breed based on a picture. The family of my girlfriend
has a dog and he's a real cutie. A couple weeks ago when I was over for dinner they talked about how many people decide to
get a dog but are not really aware of the responsibility coming with this purchase. Depending on the dogs breed people have to 
be prepared to spend more money on the diet of the dog or maybe they require specific training. I want to create a model that can
provide information about a specific breed based on a single image. This should help the family of my girlfriend to provide
more information if they have friends over and are talking about dogs but do not know the breed based on a single image.
